## SSH Clients  

### Windows
Putty is the defacto standard for free SSH clients on windows.  The putty installer can be downloaded from:  
[Putty Download](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)

Alternative SSH Clients:  
[SecureCRT](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/) - 30 Day Evaluation  
[Xshell](https://www.netsarang.com/products/xsh_overview.html) - Free for personal use.

### Linux
On Linux, the command-line SSH client is perfect.

### Mac
Mac OSX comes pre-installed with an SSH client.  Open your Applications->Utilities folder and open the Terminal Application.

SSH can be run from the command line in the resulting window.
